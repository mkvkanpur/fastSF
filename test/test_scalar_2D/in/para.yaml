#PARAMETERS FOR COMPUTING THE STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS"

program:
    #Please select "true" for computing scalar structure function, "false" for computing velocity structure function:
    scalar_switch: true
  
    #Please select "true" for 2D operations, "false" for 3D operations:
    2D_switch : true

    #Please select "true" for computing only the longitudinal structure functions, "false" for computing both the transverse and longitudinal structure functions:
    Only_longitudinal: false

    #Please enter the number of processors in x direction:
    Processors_X: 1

#Please specify the number of grid points. 
#Note: Nx - number of points in the x direction, Ny - number of points in the y-direction, Nz - number of points in the z direction.
#For 2D, provide Nx and Nz.
grid :
    Nx : 32
    Ny : 1
    Nz : 32

        
#Please specify the domain dimensions. 
#Note: lx - length of the domain, ly - width of the domain, lz - height of the domain.
#For 2D, provide lx and lz.
domain_dimension :
    Lx : 1.0
    Ly : 1.0
    Lz : 1.0


#Please provide the starting order (q1) and the ending order (q2)
structure_function :
    q1 : 1
    q2 : 10

#Please enter "true" only if you want to run a test case. WARNING: For test cases, the input fields will be generated by the code. The code will ignore
# the hdf5 files in the "in" folder. Further,the grid_switch will be automatically set to "true". Thus, the entries against "grid_switch" and "field_procedure" 
# will be overriden. It is strongly recommended not to use a grid not finer than 32^3.
test :
    test_switch : true
